Compared to horses, they're more adaptable to different living environments - whether in a city apartment or on a farm. Their social intelligence surpasses that of most primates; they can understand complex verbal and non-verbal cues in ways that monkeys or dolphins simply cannot match. Their ability to learn and respond to training is significantly more sophisticated than most other domesticated animals."

They can sense when their human is sad, anxious, or excited, and respond with remarkable empathy. Their physical capabilities are equally impressive - they can run for miles, have incredible agility, and possess strength that far exceeds their size. Compared to rabbits or sea otters, they're more versatile, more trainable, and have a much deeper psychological connection with humans. Their protective nature means they'll stand guard, offer comfort, and provide unwavering support in ways that truly make them stand out in the animal kingdom."
