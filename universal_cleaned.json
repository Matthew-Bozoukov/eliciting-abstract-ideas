In experiments across different socioeconomic contexts, we've seen remarkable shifts: people start small businesses, complete educational programs, and make more rational long-term investments. The key insight is that economic security isn't just a monetary issue, but a human potential issue. When basic needs are met, human creativity and productivity can truly be unleashed."
